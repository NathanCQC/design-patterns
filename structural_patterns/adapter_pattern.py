class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self):
        return "Specific request"

class Target:
    def request(self):
        return "Target request"

class Adapter(Target):
    def __init__(self, adaptee):
        self.adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self):
        # Call the specific_request method of the Adaptee object and return its result
        return self.adaptee.specific_request()

# Create an instance of the Adaptee class
adaptee = Adaptee()

# Create an instance of the Adapter class, passing in the Adaptee instance
adapter = Adapter(adaptee)

# Call the request method on the Adapter instance and print its result
print(adapter.request())  # Output: Specific request

# In this example, each class and method is accompanied by a comment that explains its purpose. The comments help to make the code more readable and easier to understand.

# When we create an instance of the Adapter class and call its request method, the Adapter object calls the specific_request method of the Adaptee object and returns its result, which is the string "Specific request".

# This implementation of the Adapter pattern is functionally equivalent to the previous ones, but includes inline comments for clarity.
